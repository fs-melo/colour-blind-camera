The colour transformations are applied directly to the camera stream. Switch between different colour blindness modes to see which colours can no longer be distinguished.

Supported colour blindness modes are:
* Protanopia: complete lack of red light receptors
* Deuteranopia: complete lack of green light receptors
* Tritanopia: complete lack of blue light receptors

The colour transformations use the method of Vi√©not, Brettel and Mollon, "[Digital Video Colourmaps for Checking the Legibility of Displays by Dichromats](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291520-6378%28199908%2924%3A4%3C243%3A%3AAID-COL5%3E3.0.CO%3B2-3)", Color Research and Application 24, 1999.

## Technical details

ColourBlind is written in Python using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home). It was created as a technical investigation of accessing the Android [camera2 API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary) from Python.
